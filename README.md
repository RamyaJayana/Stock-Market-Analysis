# StockMarketAnalysis
The stock market analysis employs Python to retrieve historical stock data from Alpha Vantage, computing the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. It then visualizes these moving averages alongside the stock prices using Matplotlib. This aids investors in discerning stock trends and potential trading signals by observing moving average crossovers.
